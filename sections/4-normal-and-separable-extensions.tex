\section{Normal and Separable Extensions}

Two important properties of field extensions, normality and separability, are the key ingredients for Galois extensions which we will discuss later. To pave the way for them, we need to first introduce splitting fields and algebraic closures, two closely related concepts. 

\subsection{Splitting Fields}
\begin{definition}
    Let $K$ be a field. A polynomial $f$ over $K$ \textit{splits} in $K$ if it decomposes into linear factors $$
    f(t) = k \prod _{i=1} ^n (t - \alpha_i),
    $$
    where $k, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in K$. 
\end{definition}
If $K$ is a subfield of $\C$, Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-algebra} indicates that $f$ splits over $K$ if and only if all of its zeros are contained in $K$. 

Of all the fields in which $f$ splits, we are particularly interested in the smallest:

\begin{definition}
    % A \textbf{\textit{splitting field}} of a polynomial $f$ over a subfield $K$ of $\C$ is a subfield $\Sigma$ of $\C$ such that 
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item $K \subseteq \Sigma$,
    %     \item $f$ splits over $\Sigma$ and
    %     \item for any $\Sigma'$ such that $K \subseteq \Sigma' \subseteq \Sigma$ and $f$ splits over $\Sigma'$, we have $\Sigma' = \Sigma$. 
    % \end{itemize}
    The splitting field $\Sigma$ of a polynomial $f$ over a field $K$ is defined by $$\Sigma = K(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n), $$ where $\alpha_i$ are zeros of $f$. 
\end{definition}

We see that $\Sigma$ is the smallest field containing $K$ and all zeros of $f$. The uniqueness of $\Sigma$ follows directly from its definition. Also, each $\alpha_i$ is algebraic over $K$ and their number is finite, so $\Sigma / K$ is finite by Theorem \ref{thm:finite-equi-def}. 

\begin{example}
If we have a polynomial \(p(x) = x^4 - 12x^2 + 35\) the splitting field of \(p(x)\) is \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{5},\sqrt{7}]\) as it contains all of the roots of \(p(x)\) and if it was any smaller it would not contain all of the roots or would not be a field.
\end{example}

The splitting fields of a polynomial over two isomorphic fields are isomorphic, in the following sense:

% Theorem 9.6 Stewart
\begin{theorem} \label{thm:splitting-field-unique}
	Let $\iota: K \to K'$ be a field isomorphism. Let $f$ be a polynomial over $K$ with the splitting field $\Sigma$, and then let $\Sigma'$ be the splitting field of $\iota(f)$ over $K'$. Then there is an isomorphism $j : \Sigma \to \Sigma'$ such that $j | _K = \iota$. 
\end{theorem}
\TODO add theorem 5.16 of Stewart to simple field extensions

\begin{proof}
	We construct $j$ by induction on the degree of $f$. We write $$ f(t) = k (t - \alpha_1) \ldots (t - \alpha_n), $$ where $\alpha_i \in \Sigma$ and $k \in K$. Let $m_1$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha_1$ over $K$. $m_1$ is an irreducible factor of $f$ and hence $\iota(m_1)$ is an irreducible factor of $\iota(f)$. Thus $\iota(m_1)$ splits in $\Sigma'$. Let $\iota(m_1)(t) = (t - \beta_1) \ldots (t - \beta_n)$, where $\beta_i \in \Sigma'$ and $\iota(m_1)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\beta_i$ over $K'$. Then by Theorem \TODO, there is an isomorphism $j_1 : K(\alpha_1) \to K'(\beta_1)$ such that $j_1 | _K = \iota$ and $j_1(\alpha_1) = \beta_1$. Now $f / (t - \alpha_1)$ is a polynomial over $K(\alpha_1)$ with splitting field $\Sigma$, and $\Sigma'$ is the splitting field of $\iota(f / (t - \alpha_1))$ over $K'(\beta_1)$. By induction, there exists an isomorphism $j: \Sigma \to \Sigma'$ such that $j | _{K(\alpha_1)} = j_1$ and therefore $j | _K = \iota$. 
\end{proof}

\TODO maybe place the definitions somewhere else?
\begin{definition} \label{def:automorphism}
	Let $L/K$ be a field extension. A $K$-automorphism $\phi$ of $L$ is an automorphism of $L$ such that $\phi(a) = a$ for all $a \in K$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	Let $K \subseteq M \subseteq L$. A $K$-monomorphism $\phi : M \to L$ is a monomorphism from $M$ to $L$ such that $\phi(a) = a$ for all $a \in K$. 
\end{definition}

If $\Sigma$ is the splitting field of a polynomial over $K$, the next theorem enables us to ``extend" a $K$-monomorphism $M \to \Sigma$ to a $K$-automorphism of $\Sigma$, where $K \subseteq M \subseteq L$. 

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:monomorphism-extend-automorphism}
	Let $f$ be a polynomial over $K$ with splitting field $\Sigma$. Let $M$ be an intermediate field such that $K \subseteq M \subseteq \Sigma$. Let $\tau$ be a $K$-monomorphism $M \to \Sigma$. Then there exists a $K$-automorphism $\sigma$ of $\Sigma$ such that $\sigma | _M = \tau$.  
%	Let $L/K$ be a normal field extension and let $M$ be an intermediate field such that $K \subseteq M \subseteq L$. Let $\tau$ be a $K$-monomorphism $M \to L$. Then there exists a $K$-automorphism $\sigma$ of $L$ such that $\sigma | _M = \tau$.  
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
%	By (i) $\Rightarrow$ (ii) of Theorem \ref{thm:normal-equiv-def}, 
	$\Sigma$ is the splitting field for $f$ over $K$ and thus also over $M$. $\tau$ can be considered as an isomorphism from $M$ to $\tau(M)$ which fixes every element in $K$ and hence $f$. Then $\Sigma$ is both the splitting field for $f$ over $M$ and the splitting field for $f$ over $\tau(M)$. Then by Theorem \ref{thm:splitting-field-unique}, there exists an isomorphism $\sigma: \Sigma \to \Sigma$ such that $\sigma | _M = \tau$. Since $\sigma | _K = \tau |_K = \Id$, $\sigma$ is a $K$-automorphism of $\Sigma$. 
\end{proof}

When $f$ is irreducible, we can then construct an $K$-automorphism of $\Sigma$ that sends a certain zero of $f$ to another.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:automorphism-from-zeros}
	Let $f$ be an irreducible polynomial over $K$ with splitting field $\Sigma$. Let $\alpha, \beta \in \Sigma$ be zeros of $f$. Then there exists a $K$-automorphism $\sigma$ of $\Sigma$ such that $\sigma(\alpha) = \beta$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	$K(\alpha)/K$ and $K(\beta)/K$ are isomorphic extensions by \TODO(Corollary 5.13). The isomorphism from $K(\alpha)$ to $K(\beta)$ is also a $K$-monomorphism from $K(\alpha)$ to $\Sigma$ and thus can be extended to a $K$-automorphism $\sigma$ of $\Sigma$ by Theorem \ref{thm:monomorphism-extend-automorphism}, where $\sigma(\alpha) = \beta$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Algebraic Closures}
\begin{definition}
	A field $K$ is \textit{algebraically closed} if every non-constant polynomial over $F$ has a root in $K$. 
\end{definition}

Clearly $\C$ is algebraically closed by Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-algebra}. It can be shown that we can extend any field to an algebraically closed one. 

\begin{definition}
	The smallest algebraically closed extension of a field $K$ is its \textit{algebraic closure}, denoted as $\overline K$.
\end{definition}

For example, $\C  = \overline \R$. 

If we define the splitting field of \textit{a set of polynomials} over a field $K$ as the smallest field containing $K$ and all zeros of every polynomial in the set, then it can be shown that the algebraic closure of a field $K$ is the splitting field of the set of \textit{all} polynomials over $K$. In other words, any polynomial over $K$ splits in $\overline K$. In addition, any polynomial over $\overline K$ splits in $\overline K$.

Isomorphic fields have isomorphic algebraic closures, in the following sense:

\begin{theorem} 
	Let $\iota: K \to K'$ be a field isomorphism. Then there is an isomorphism $j: \overline K \to \overline {K'}$ such that $j |_K = \iota$. 
\end{theorem}

The proof is omitted.

%\begin{definition}
%    A field $K$ is algebraically closed if every polynomial $f$ over $K$ has a root in $K$. 
%\end{definition}
%
%\begin{theorem}
%    For a field $K$, its smallest algebraically closed extension is the algebraic closure of $K$.
%\end{theorem}



\subsection{Normal Extensions}

We now state the definition of a normal extension $L/K$, which says that an irreducible polynomial over $K$ has ``none or all'' of its zeros in $L$. 

\begin{definition}
    An algebraic field extension $L/ K$ is \textit{normal} if every irreducible polynomial over $K$ which has a zero in $L$ splits in $L$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	For any field $K$, $\overline K / K$ is a normal extension, as every polynomial over $K$ splits in $\overline K$. In particular, $\C / \R$ is normal. 
\end{example}


\begin{example}
    Let $K = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2})$. Then $K / \Q$ is not normal. The polynomial $f(t) = t^3 - 2$ over $\Q$ is irreducible and has a zero $\sqrt[3]{2}$ in $K$, but $K \subseteq \R$ does not contain the two non-real zeros of $f$. Hence $f$ does not split in $K$.
\end{example}

We now establish some equivalent statements as a finite extension being normal.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:normal-equiv-def}
    Let $L/K$ be an finite field extension. Then the following three statements are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item $L/K$ is normal;
        \item $L$ is the splitting field for a polynomial $f$ over $K$;
        \item Any $K$-monomorphism $\sigma: L \to \overline K$ is a $K$-automorphism of $L$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    (i) $\Rightarrow$ (ii). 
    Suppose $L/K$ is normal and finite. The finiteness of $L/K$ implies that $L = K(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_r)$ for $r$ finite and $\alpha_i$ algebraic over $K$ by Theorem \ref{thm:finite-equi-def}. For each $\alpha_i$, take the minimal polynomial $f_i$ of $\alpha_i$ over $K$. Each $f_i$ is irreducible over $K$, so the normality of $L/K$ implies that $f_i$ splits in $L$.  Then take $f = f_1 \dots f_r$ and $L$ is the splitting field of $f$.
	
%	    For each $\alpha \in L$, let $f_\alpha$ be its minimal polynomial over $K$. Each $f_\alpha$ is irreducible over $K$, so the normality of $L/K$ implies that $f_\alpha$ splits in $L$. Then clearly $L$ is the splitting field of $\{ f_\alpha \text{ over } K : \alpha \in L \}$.    
    

    (ii) $\Rightarrow$ (iii). Let $\sigma$ be a $K$-monomophism from $L$ to $\overline K$. $\sigma$ can be considered as an isomorphism from $L$ to $\sigma(L)$ which fixes all elements in $K$. Since $L$ is the splitting field for a polynomial $f$ over $K$, $f$ have coefficients in $K$ and thus is fixed under $\sigma$. Hence $\sigma(L) = L$ and $\sigma$ is a $K$-automorphism of $L$. 
    
    (iii) $\Rightarrow$ (i). Let $f$ be an irreducible polynomial over $K$ with a zero $\alpha$ and let $L = K(\alpha)$. Let $\Sigma$ be the splitting field of $f$ over $K$. For any zero $\beta \in \Sigma$ of $f$, there exists a $K$-automorphism $\sigma$ of $\Sigma $ such that $\sigma(\alpha) = \beta$ by Theorem \ref{thm:automorphism-from-zeros}. Since $L \subseteq \Sigma \subseteq \overline K$, $\sigma | _ L$ is a $K$-monomorphism $L \to \Sigma$ or also $L \to \overline K$. By assumption, $\sigma|_L(L) = L$. With $\alpha \in L$ we deduce that $\beta \in L$. Hence $L/K$ is normal.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
	Let $K = \Q (\sqrt 2)$. Then $K$ is the splitting field for $f(t) = t^2 - 2$ over $\Q$, and thus $K/ \Q$ is normal. We also know that any $\Q$-monomorphism $\sigma: K \to \C$ is a $\Q$-automorphism of $K$. That is, $\sigma$ can only send $\sqrt 2$ to $\pm \sqrt 2$. 
\end{example}


\subsection{Separable Extensions}

Galois did not specifically acknowledge the idea of separability, as he solely worked with subfields of $\C$, where separability is inherently present, as we will discover. Let us first work on separable polynomials.

\begin{definition}
    Let $f$ be an irreducible polynomial over field $K$. Then $f$ is \textit{separable} over $K$ if $f$ takes the form 
    $$
        f(t) = k(t - \sigma_1) \dots (t - \sigma_n)
    $$
    where $\sigma_i \in \overline K$ are distinct.
\end{definition}

The following theorem of a computational nature is useful to determine whether a polynomial is separable and is given without proof. 

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:separable-derivative}
    A polynomial $f$ over a subfield $K$ of $\C$ is separable if and only if it is coprime with $Df$ over $K$, where $Df$ is its derivative. 
\end{theorem}

The next theorem implies that we can take for granted the separability of irreducible polynomials over subfields of $\C$. 

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:separable-poly-in-C}
    If $K$ is a subfield of $\C$, then every irreducible polynomial over $K$ is separable. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $f$ be an irreducible polynomial over $K$. Suppose that $f$ is not separable, then by Theorem \ref{thm:separable-derivative}, $f$ and $Df$ shares a common factor of degree $\ge 1$. Since $f$ is irreducible, this common factor must be $f$. Since $Df$ has a smaller degree than $f$, $Df$ must be $0$. This implies that $f$ is constant.
\end{proof}

We now introduce the notion of separability of an extension in a recursive fashion.

\begin{definition}
    Let $L/K$ be a field extension. An element $\alpha \in L$ is \textit{separable} if the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $K$ is separable over $K$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} \label{def:separable-extension}
    A field extension $L / K$ is \textit{separable} if every $\alpha \in L$ is separable.
\end{definition}

We can also take for granted the separability of any field extension within $\C$:

\begin{theorem}
    A field extension $L/K$ such that $K \subseteq L \subseteq \mathbb C$ is separable. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    This directly follows from Theorem \ref{thm:separable-poly-in-C} and Definition \ref{def:separable-extension}. 
\end{proof}
